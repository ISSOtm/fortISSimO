; Some terminology notes:
; - An "order" is a table of pointers to "patterns".
; - A "pattern" is a series of up to 64 "rows".
; - A "table" is a subpattern
;
; "TODO: loose" means that this `hli` could be used as an optimisation point

; PREVIEW_MODE is defined when assembling for hUGETracker.
; hUGETracker contains a Game Boy emulator (the "G" in "UGE"), and it relies on some cooperation
; from the driver to signal key updates.
; This goes both ways, though: don't try to run PREVIEW_MODE code outside of hUGETracker!

DEF PATTERN_LENGTH equ 64 ; How many rows in a pattern.
DEF ROW_SIZE equ 3 ; How many bytes per row.
DEF ORDER_WIDTH equ 2 ; How many bytes in each order entry.

MACRO No ; For "empty" entries in the JR tables.

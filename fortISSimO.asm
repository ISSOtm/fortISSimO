; If you want to use fortISSimO inside of hUGETracker itself, please read the following.
;
; fortISSimO is designed to be usable inside of hUGETracker, however:
;  - This is somewhat experimental, and it's possible to glitch out, hang, and/or crash hUGETracker.
;  - At this time, a hUGETracker bug prevents the "note cut" effect (`E`) from working on CH3.
;    This does not affect ROM exports.
;  - To configure fortISSimO for use in hUGETracker, please uncomment the following line (delete the semicolon),
;    and make sure to write the hUGETracker version between quotation marks.
;    For example, you'd get:   DEF HUGETRACKER equs "1.0"

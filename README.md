# fortISSimO

[![CC0 licensed (public domain)](https://licensebuttons.net/p/zero/1.0/80x15.png)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

A speed- and size-focused Game Boy music driver.

For documentation and example of usage, see [fortISSimO-demo](https://github.com/ISSOtm/fortISSimO-demo).

This driver can be used as a drop-in replacement of [SuperDisk's GB sound driver][hUGEDriver].
A table [comparing pros and cons of many GB music drivers](https://github.com/ISSOtm/fortISSimO/wiki/Drivers-comparison) is available on the wiki.

## Quick start

fortISSimO should be usable by simply replacing `hUGEDriver.asm` with `fortISSimO.asm`.
I am for that to be the case, anyway; please feel free to report any incompatibilities [as issues](https://github.com/ISSOtm/fortISSimO/issues/new).

### RGBDS

0. **Required**: RGBDS 0.5.0 or later.
1. [Include](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/v0.6.0/rgbasm.5/#Including_other_source_files) `fortISSimO.asm` from another source file.
   This is required because `fortISSimO.asm` lacks a [`SECTION` directive](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/v0.6.0/rgbasm.5/#SECTIONS), so that you can put it in whatever section you desire.
2. Export your songs from hUGETracker using the "Export to RGBDS .asm..." option.
3. Both `fortISSimO.asm` and all files exported by hUGETracker contain `INCLUDE "include/hUGE.inc"` (referring to [this file](https://github.com/ISSOtm/fortISSimO/blob/master/include/hUGE.inc)).
   You may need to pass [a `-i` flag](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/v0.6.0/rgbasm.1#i) to RGBASM for it to work (e.g. [`-i src/fortISSimO`](https://github.com/ISSOtm/fortISSimO-demo/blob/d10a2107ac46cef3933f6ec21d9cfef91b232743/Makefile#L29)).
4. At least once before the first call to `hUGE_TickSound` (so, for example, [during boot-up](https://github.com/ISSOtm/fortISSimO-demo/blob/d10a2107ac46cef3933f6ec21d9cfef91b232743/src/main.asm#L70-L74)), you must set `hUGE_MutedChannels` (usually to 0 to enable all channels).

### GBDK

0. **Required**: RGBDS 0.5.0 or later, `rgb2sdas` from hUGEDriver (a pre-built Windows binary lies [in `gbdk_example/`](https://github.com/SuperDisk/hUGEDriver/tree/master/gbdk_example), and its source code in [`tools/`](https://github.com/SuperDisk/hUGEDriver/tree/master/tools)).
1. Build `fortISSimO.asm`:
   ```bash
   rgbasm fortISSimO.asm -o fortISSimO.obj -DGBDK
   ```
2. Convert it to a SDCC object file:
   ```bash
   rgb2sdas fortISSimO.obj
   ```
3. Use `#include <hUGEDriver.h>` (you may need to adapt that path and/or use `-I`) as desired.
4. Link `fortISSimO.obj.o` as part of your build.
